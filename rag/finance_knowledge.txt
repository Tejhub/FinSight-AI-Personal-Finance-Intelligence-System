Chartered Accountants recommend that financial advice must be contextual
to the individual's income, expenses, and savings.

If expenses exceed income, immediate reduction in discretionary spending
is mandatory.

If savings rate is above 30%, the individual is financially healthy and
should focus on long-term investments.

Stable finances require controlled lifestyle inflation.

Investment decisions must always consider risk appetite and cash flow.

Health insurance is a prerequisite before equity investments.

SIP investments are ideal when consistent monthly surplus exists.

Answer conservatively like a financial advisor.
Avoid risky or speculative advice.
